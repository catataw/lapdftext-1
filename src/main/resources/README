This folder contains resources that are used by general functionality of the system. 

Including rule files. 

Importantly, we also generate the JAXB classes for open access journal data from the jats-archiving-xsd-1.0.zip file here. 
This forms the basis of all of our manipulation and management of full-text articles from this complex XML schema.

We execute the command to generate the source code as follows:

xjc -extension -b jats_bindings.xjb  jats-archiving-xsd-1.0/JATS-archivearticle1.xsd 

Assuming that we have expanded the jats-archiving-xsd-1.0.zip archive into a folder named  jats-archiving-xsd-1.0.
