THE 17TH ANNIVERSARY
?Om Swastiastu...?
It has been 17 years since Bali & Beyond magazine was born. Just like a person, Bali & Beyond has gone through a lot of adjustments to keep it updated with the current era ? it was fi rst published as a tabloid and then went through a lot of remodeling until it became the magazine that you now see. But although the design has been changing, our mission to support all aspects of the culture, tourism, and lifestyle in Bali and beyond will never change. 17th In Indonesia, the birthday marks how one is ready to embark on a more colorful journey, as one can still be as carefree as a child but also has to be more responsible like an adult. This is the philosophy of the Westin Rainbow Cake, courtesy of the new pastry chef at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali that you can fi nd in ?DINE & DELIGHTS? ? alongside three other extravagant cakes from Mulia Bali, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts Bali, 17th and Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran. All are made especially to celebrate our anniversary. Bali is also known for its charm of mixing both worlds ? the traditional and the modern. And this is something we would also like to celebrate. Flip through CRAFT & CULTURE to see how Bali has become a melting pot for Indonesian culture. FASHION FOLIO also embraces the beauty of integrating traditional and modern aspects. Meanwhile, a stay at The St. Regis Bali Resort in REST & RELAXATION and a trip to Nusa Lembongan with Pulau Luxury Charters in LITTLE LOVES will take you on a luxurious modern getaway. 17th We invite you to join us in celebrating our anniversary. After all, everything that we do means nothing without you, our loyal readers. So before you fl ip through our pages, raise your glass with us and say? CHEERS!

&CULTURE
CRAFT
THE CULTURE CALLING
FROM A BIG FESTIVAL TO SMALLER SACRED CER-EMONIES, BALI HOSTS A NUMBER OF CULTURAL FESTIVITIES THAT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED...
hen I fi rst came to Bali in the early 90?s, was a case of love at fi rst sight in many ways. I was never sure why this small island held sway over me but when I wasn?t here it seemed to call to me like a siren from the sea, so strong that since 2009 I have made Bali my second home, returning again and again for longer and longer periods of time to a place whose welcome is warmer each time I set foot on its ancient soil. What is it that draws me to this place? Is it the towering mountains, the azure blue ocean, its impossibly
wonderful people or its exotic and highly complex culture? Or is it simply a combination of all of those things? Balinese culture ? which permeates society at every level and binds its peoples like glue ? is what I fi nd the most endearing. I awake each morning to the sight of our housekeeper silently praying and giving offerings at the family temple, laying out delicately crafted canang over which she performs her daily ritual. The sweet smell of incense wafts slowly throughout the house bringing with a state of wellbeing. As I walk to the beach I will hear the sound of tinkling bells from children practicing the fl amboyant
gamelan. Giant funeral processions meander down my street at least once a week ? the women resplendent in spectacular kebaya while the men carry, shoulder high, a towering sarcophagus followed by an orchestra of gamelan and drums beating out a fi nal farewell to send the departed on to the next life. Bali is many things, but the one thing it is defi nitely not is dull!
MELTING POT
In Bali, visitors or long-term travelers don?t have to go far to witness some of the most astonishing cultural activities. Apart from the funerals, the daily temple rituals, and the numerous ceremonies celebrating
22
BALI&BEYOND JULY 2015
all manner of occasions, there is one melting pot that should not be missed. Each year from mid-June to mid-July a giant parade makes its way slowly though the elegant streets of Denpasar, signifying the opening of the Bali Arts Festival ? a month-long celebration of dance, theatre, and all things cultural. For anyone who has never visited Indonesia, this parade is a unique opportunity to witness thousands of ethnicities from across the country, resplendent in their traditional costumes to proudly ?show off? their corner of the archipelago.
The parade, often three to four kilometers long, will meander along the tree lined streets and eventually make its way past the dais where the President of Indonesia ? along with many of his cabinet and other dignitaries from around the world ? will watch a spectacle that rivals anything to be seen anywhere. This wonderful spectacle is a chance for the Balinese ? and indeed all the other participants ? to ?dress up? in elaborate costumes, apply their intricate make up, and demonstrate their centuries old traditions all in one place. Dayaks from Borneo, dancers from Sumatra,
fi erce-looking warriors from West Papua, red and black clad men and women from Tana Toraja in Sulawesi, and many, many more will pass in a riot of unbelievable color. This parade is, in my humble opinion, one of the wonders of the world and an opportunity to see ethnic diversity on display all in one setting. It is nothing short of a breathtaking experience.
FEAST OF CULTURE
It is no coincidence that Bali, which hosts this festival, is a cradle of creativity. Bali is a place where the local people still hold on fi ercely
BALI&BEYOND JULY 2015
23
to their unique roots, even under a barrage of outside infl uences in this fast-changing world. Down small alleys and in the rural villages each and every day, colorful weddings, tooth fi ling ceremonies, three-month infant blessings, and a myriad of other ceremonies are performed. The Balinese, being the welcoming people that they are, will have no hesitation in welcoming strangers into their homes and temples to witness the ceremonies, and providing their visitors some food and drink and making them feel like they are part of the ritual. Bali provides a feast of ?culture? in every corner, if you just take the time to seek it out. With a little effort, one can fi nd the spectacular Kecak dancers who create their own rhythms by the slapping of various body parts and an unbelievable
combination of sounds created by tongue movements. Elegant Topeng and Legong dance rituals are performed all over the island at various times of the year and are intricate and spectacular in their execution. Take the meandering road up to Ubud and beyond, and stop at the villages that specialize in various crafts. There, wood carvers, metal workers, silversmiths and numerous
other industries ply their trades as they have for hundreds of years. The culture here is a rich tapestry and an article such as this can only skim the surface, for I haven?t got the space to touch on the puppeteers, the musicians, the painters, the sculptors, or the architects. So if you have read this far, put aside that cocktail and head out there, for a  whole new world awaits! By Paul V. Walters

BALI 4 Night Surfi ng BUCKET LIST Night surfi ng at Komune in Keramas is the fi rst permanent night surfi ng installation in the world! The surfi ng sessions are scheduled ?
LIFESTYLE
each session only allows six surfers in the water at the same time, so it is better to book in advance. However, since surfi ng these waves in the evening can be really daunting, this activity is recommended for advance surfers only. Others can enjoy munching on Komune?s delicious pizzas and sipping their strong cocktails while watching the local surfers from one of Bali boardrider clubs shred the waves at their night surfi ng show. But please do check the weather and the wave conditions before you go. www.komuneresorts.com

Mount Batur
Hiking to the top of the mountain takes about two hours, and believe me, you want to see the sunrise from up there. Bali Trekking & Tour Guide can guide you to the top of Mount Batur for just Rp. 650,000/person, with minimum of two people in the tour. Yes, you can fi nd cheaper options, but Bali Trekking & Tour Guide will save you from the hassle of renting a car as they will pick you up and drive you to the starting point at the Toyabungkah Village in Kintamani, and then guide you to the top of the mountain. www.balitrekkingtour.com

Flyboarding
This new and exhilarating water-based activity of fl yboarding is now available in Tanjung Benoa! First introduced to the island in late 2014 by Flyboard Bali, fl yboarding is not for the faint hearted ? although beginners are very much welcome to try it out. The sport relies on the strength of your lower body and good sense of balance. You will wear a special boots attached to a board that is connected by a long hose to a jetski ? the jetski will give water pressure to the board, and the jet nozzles underneath the board will boost you up to 15 meters above the water. Pretty cool, isn?t it? www.fl yboard-bali.com

Kite Festival
Taking place at Padang Galak in the Sanur area, this annual festival is not to be missed. This kite festival is actually a competition between villages in the Denpasar area, and the kites are believed to deliver prayers and gratitude to the Gods in the hope of a good harvest season. The most unique part is the kites are huge in size ? they can be up to four meters wide and ten meters long, and are designed with unique shapes such as Bebean (fi sh), Janggan (birds), and Pecukan (leaves). The next best part is that it?s free for anyone to watch! Don?t forget your camera, as you will defi nitely get some cool shots for your Instagram throwback posts.

Colorful Menjangan
The trip to Menjangan Island, which is located just off the coast of the West Bali National Park, takes about a three-hour drive from South Bali, followed by another 20-minute boat ride. For an ultimate adventure, why don?t you book in at The Menjangan, a wonderful resort on the west coast of the national park? For guests, The Menjangan can arrange a snorkeling trip to the small and uninhabited Menjangan Island, where the waters are crystal clear. There are seven world-class diving sites that offer magnifi cent coral gardens and plunging reef walls. Expect to see a vast range of marine life such as sea fans, reef sharks, and schools of snapper. www.themenjangan.com

Bali?s Best Pool
The pool at the Hanging Gardens Ubud deserves its prominence as one of the most famous, if not the best, swimming pools in the world. Set in the middle of the resort?s 3.2 hectares of land, this iconic twin-level swimming pool is the place for an ultimate luxurious getaway. As you take a plunge into this gorgeous pool, your senses will be overawed by the stunning surrounding rainforest and the calming sounds of the Ayung River below. For couples, the ?Romance under the Stars? is a unique dining experience for two where you dine on a specially made wooden platform on the pool with the stars twinkling high above. www.hanginggardensubud.com

Baby Turtle Release
Why don?t you enrich your knowledge about the endangered sea turtles, and help them start their adventure in the big ocean? Interested? Head to the Turtle Conservation and Education Center in Serangan, a small island just off the coast of Sanur. The center is striving to save these turtles from becoming an endangered species -they take care of injured animals and collect turtle eggs from tourist beaches and bring them to their hatchery. If you?re lucky, you might be able to release one of these month old hatchlings to the sea from Serangan?s white sandy beach. www.turtleconservancy.org

Yoga Classes
This famous spot in Ubud is wonderful for yoga and healing, and the perfect sanctuary for weary souls. Nestled among the rice paddies, the Yoga Barn offers 75 yoga classes a week conducted by professional instructors. There are also meditation classes and holistic therapies, but the one you must try is the Vinyasa Flow Yoga that will surely drench you with sweat ? which is why it is my favorite. As for those who are more concerned with healing, you should try the Yin Yoga for Healing class, which requires less athletic prowess though that doesn?t mean you?d be less sweaty. www.theyogabarn.com

Healthy Breakfast
Offering hearty and healthy smoothie bowls, Nalu Bowls is great for a sweet and refreshing treat during Bali?s balmy days. Inspired by Hawaiian culture that revolves around surfi ng and tropical ingredients, Nalu Bowls is perfect for the wave chasers out there to munch before or after surfi ng. Each of their bowls consists of locally sourced ingredients like dragon fruit, fresh coconut, mango, papaya, spinach and bananas. I can wager that once you?ve tried one of these amazing bowls, you?ll go bananas for more ? pun intended. www.nalubowls.com

Fun Teppanyaki
KO Japanese Restaurant at the InterContinental Resort Jimbaran is the perfect place for a fun interactive Teppanyaki experience. Imagine this while cooking delectable Japanese specialties, the chefs entertain you with acrobatic moves and tricks, like chopping the omelets with what can only be described as superhuman speed, and the pièce de résistance ? the fl  for steak and desserts. And all is done right before your very eyes! Must try: the Uluwatu Teppanyaki, a seven-course menu that includes tuna sashimi, a California roll, a fresh half lobster with lemon butter sauce, a tender beef tenderloin with red wine sauce, and a banana Teppanyaki that comes with a surprisingly amazing tofu ice cream! www.bali.intercontinental.com

Canyoning
Adventure & Spirit is the one for this marvelous activity, as it offers a wide range of packages with different levels of diffi culties and duration. They also provide an eight-day Canyoneer Training Course, where at the end of it you?ll be quite an expert in jumping, sliding, caving, wading, abseiling, and sliding down Bali?s natural slopes, gorges, and waterfalls. www.adventureandspirit.com
24
Waterfall Hopping
There are three waterfalls in Munduk you should visit: Golden Valley, Tanah Barak, and Melanting. Starting at the Golden Valley Waterfall is the best, as it is located on higher ground and you can savor the lush tropical forest on your way down to the Melanting Waterfall. Don?t be scared of getting lost, as there will be signs along the path. The best way to go waterfall hopping in Munduk is to start in the morning by a car. Book a place to stay for at least two nights for a full adventure ? the Munduk Moding Plantation Nature Resort & Spa offers trekking packages to the waterfalls. For more options, you can also visit Gitgit Waterfall. www.mundukmodingplantation.com

Super Cold Brews
Now as a professional beach bum myself, I believe that cold -2o beer is the best company when watching the sun set. And centigrade beers at the S.K.A.I.

Picnic up North
This is probably the cheapest option in this list. All you need to do is buy some food, then head up north to the Bedugul Botanical Gardens. The entrance fee is Rp. 7,000/person for domestic visitors and Rp. 18,000/ person for foreign visitors. The garden is open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and there you can enjoy lunch in the lush forest with a fresh breeze. The little ones can also learn all about the fl ora in Indonesia, as they have a cactus garden, a herbarium and much more. www.balibotanicgarden.org

Boasting a chapel-like structure with a literal glass ceiling, this new club and lounge is the place to be seen. But now you don?t have to wait until Friday to have a great night out, as Mirror has themed parties every Wednesday. The fi rst Wednesday of the month is the ?Dolce & Banana?, where the dance fl oor is packed with unicorns in glitter, sparkles, and big wigs. On the second Wednesday, Mirror presents a night of old and new disco called ?Night Fever?. Dubbed ?Provocateur?, the third week is for blood red lipstick, killer heels, lingerie, and burlesque performances. The last Wednesday of the month is ?Re:Format?, an open format music night where local talent is invited to play whatever music they want! www.mirror.id

The Silent Day
This is the one thing you must do before you die. Trust me, you will only need to do this once to get the memory of a lifetime. Spending Nyepi Day (the Day of Silence) in Bali feels like being transferred to another universe where everything is calm and you can really feel the spiritual atmosphere. There are plenty of hotels and resorts offering Nyepi packages where you can enjoy a full-board accommodation and relaxing activities like enjoying spa treatments. However, I would personally recommend that you rent a one-bedroom villa in Canggu, Ubud, or Uluwatu to experience the real feeling of Nyepi. Also, the Ogoh-Ogoh festival held all across the island to ward off evil spirits just before Nyepi begins is a must-watch.

Mad T-Party
This unique high tea pays homage to Alice in Wonderland?s Mad Hatters Tea Party. The Mad T-Party at W Bali offers sweet and quirky treats designed by Australia?s most celebrated pâtissier, Adriano Zumbo. These delights will also be accompanied by freshly-brewed tea and coffee, amazing French champagne, and six bespoke cocktails. You should try the unique and scrumptious Babi Guling (suckling pig) macaroons, which is the one and only on the island ? if not the world! As for the special cocktails, my favorite is the Earl Grey Mandarin Sour, a lethal concoction of Beluga Vodka, orange juice, and Earl Grey syrup topped with Earl Grey foam. It is clear now why this high tea is a mad one? www.wretreatbali.com

Courtesy of Executive Pastry Chef Eddy Dhenin, who has been working in the pastry industry since 2001, the Josette-Cassis cake does not just look stunning ? and delectable, of course ? but also has a story that is really personal to the chef. The cake is named after his mother Josette and the town he grew up in, Cassis, France, and reminds him a lot of his childhood. This classic delight consists of fl ourless French chocolate

The 17th birthday is one of the most important days in one?s life, as it marks how one is ready to embark on a more colorful life ? and that is the philosophy of this vibrant rainbow cake, courtesy of Executive Pastry Chef Wizdan Purnama at The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali. The Westin Rainbow Cake consists of six layers ? blueberry, green tea, raspberry, lemon, mango, and orange. The texture of the cake is very soft and that?s what we love about it. But of course, we didn?t have the heart to cut the cake at fi rst as the decoration looks so festive. This rainbow cake is embellished with colorful pieces of chocolate on the outside, each color representing a layer inside. Chef Wizdan uses three techniques to create the decorations on top of the cake ? pouring sugar for the green leaves, pulling sugar for the branches, and blowing sugar for the balloons. To top it off, he completes the cake with a cream cheese frosting and lemon macaroons.

We share the same vision ? that?s important to have with your business partner. Times when we can?t come to a conclusion is generally when one of us is ? or both of us are ? not in a good mood. The downside is because we are family, sometimes it?s hard to leave our emotions behind.
BB: Where do you get your inspiration when designing your new collections? PK: From our surroundings, including street style, bloggers, and high-end runways. Traveling also leaves us totally inspired with new ideas, colors, and moods. Alongside our main collections, we released a mini-series called Archipelago to embrace Indonesia?s rich heritage and to encourage the use of Indonesian prints as part of daily activities and ready-to-wear pieces. But our main inspiration is our own customers. We research which style is the favorite, which ones are the best-selling. We listen to our customer?s suggestions and what they?re looking for in clothes. We collect these ideas for our next collection.

Creating their very own print design, the brand Paulina Katarina offers a range of chic styles for any women, on any occasion. Here these sisters (PK) share their love for fashion with Bali & Beyond (BB).
PK: We were around 12 years old when we started making our own clothes. Our parents established their own clothing manufacturing company in the late ?70s in Bali, and the factory was right next to our house. Back then, clothing selections in Bali were very limited. So every time we wanted to wear something different for an event, like a simple black tube top, we went next door (the factory) and had them made.

SHINE LIKE A DIAMOND
The most unique part of the Cocoon Medical Spa is that each treatment room is like a cocoon ? it?s almost as if you walk in as a caterpillar and walk out as a butterfl y. Once I fi nished my drink I was taken to one of these ?cocoons? where a dermatologist examined my skin thoroughly ? she decided I should take the Cleopatra Gold 3 with Microdermabrasion and Dermapen, which is best to conceal the scar on my chin because of the surgery I had after an accident.

It doesn?t seem too much to ask, knowing that this treatment will help your skin glow. Once she was sure I understood the procedures, the Diamond Microdermabrasion started my facial journey. Using vacuum technology to whisk away dead skin and a
hand-held wand with a diamond tip to exfoliate the skin, this step renews healthy cells to make your skin as smooth as a baby?s. Moving on, the next step is the Dermapen Microneedling, an advanced micro-surgical needling that stimulates skin to naturally and safely regenerate and repair itself, and eventually creates new collagen without damaging the epidermis.

Finally, fi nish with the 24 Carat Gold Collagen Moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and moist. You can go back to your usual routine the next day, but please give your skin some rest for a couple of days ? this includes avoiding direct sunlight and alcohol-based toners. Don?t forget to ask Cocoon Medical Spa about the aftercare. Following the aftercare guidelines ? and continuing the treatment on your next visit ? is highly recommended so that
just scars but also wrinkles, leading to brighter, healthier, and younger-looking skin. The last stage is the LED Light Therapy, which is my favorite. Our skin has the ability to absorb and use light as energy for healing, so the LED Light Therapy helps skin cells produce more collagen and heal faster. This therapy also improves skin elasticity increasing blood circulation and oxygen fl ow while releasing toxins, which, of course, aid in the anti-ageing process.
facial journey at Cocoon Medical Spa is done, but it doesn?t mean that the whole treatment is over. There are some steps you should do back at home to make sure you get the best results. Before you go to sleep, apply the Gold Collagen Mask for 20 minutes to boost your collagen production. It is also highly effective for soothing and hydrating your skin, as well as making it softer. Then, apply the 24 Carat Hyaluronic Acid Gold Serum that consists of an ancient gold formula to help rejuvenate skin cells and reduce fi ne lines and wrinkles.

Pulau Luxury Charters also offers special events like weddings, dive trips, fi shing trips, and a champagne sunset cruise experience. It is already popular among the rich and famous, so if you are looking for a glamorous voyage for a special occasion, look no

A SNEAK PEEK INTO AN AIKIDO CLASS, A FIGHTING STYLE THAT TEACHES US TO USE OUR OPPONENT?S ENERGY TO
OUR ADVANTAGE...
rom the the training center (also known as the dojo) looks huge and intimidating. The walls and the teak wood make the building seem very masculine, but a modern Japanese
touch adds a charming aura to the place. Stepping inside, there are no screams or shouts heard, either from the students or the sensei (teachers) ? not like what we usually fi nd in other martial art classes. Maybe it is
because Aikido is refered to as ?the martial art of love.? But what does love have to do with martial arts, you might wonder. After all, martial arts aim to hurt other people, so how can love become an ingredient in a fi ghting style that was

fi rst created around a war era? ?Aikido is about the synchronization of movement, just like melody and lyrics,? explains Rai Wibawa, the founder of Bali Aikikai. Wibawa is a 4th degree Aikido black belt and 5th degree Shotokan karate sensei. ?In Aikido, we do not break nor block the fl ow of ?ki? ? the energy of our training partner or aggressor in real life. Instead, we channel it and redirect it for our own benefi t.? On my visit to the dojo, I was amazed to see a small young lady throw her training partner onto the mattress ? believe me, the male opponent seemed to be way heavier than she was. And I was in awe even more with the fact that she did it with a fl at expression and didn?t even
break a sweat as a big thud echoed through the hall. This clearly shows how momentum and redirecting the aggressor?s power are the key factors in this martial art.
have a balanced relationship,? he says. ?Meanwhile, other martial arts only teach us how to fi ght.? Rai was originally a Karate sensei before he mastered Aikido ? it was in 1995 that he fi rst welcomed Aikido into his Karate dojo. Karate and Aikido are obviously two very different martial arts, but what exactly are the differences? ?The differences lie in the core philosophy and how to defend ourselves from the incoming attack during a fi ght. In Karate, we counter the attack, while in Aikido, we move around the attack and use our opponent?s energy to create momentum without any force. In Aikido, we end our moves by pinning the aggressor to the ground with a joint lock,? he explains. No
HARMONIOUS SPIRIT
Rai Wibawa is a well built man and probably around 50 years young, but for sure age has not made him any weaker. Instead, his face shines with wisdom. His positive aura is undeniable. He explained almost everything about Aikido, from the physical factors to the philosophies. ?What is really interesting about Aikido is that it teaches us how cooperate with our surroundings, something that we can apply in our daily lives, like how to work together with our spouse to
BALI BALI&BEYOND &BEYOND JULY JULY 2015

wonder this self-defense art is also called ?the harmonious spirit? since we learn to defend ourselves without harming our aggressor.
CARPE DIEM
In Japanese martial arts there is a saying, ?Ichi-go, Ichi e.? It is the concept of appreciating our meeting with other people, respecting the moment, and seizing it because nobody knows what tomorrow will bring ? we never know when is the last time we?re going to meet people, do we? This means we should not waste time and always seek progress by giving our best in each training session. And that we should also show others our greatest respect. In the western world, this concept is called ?Carpe Diem.?
After I bid goodbye to Rai Wibawa and walked out of the dojo, I looked back once again. The dojo might look quite intimidating, but once the main doors are open there is nothing but synchronized movements, harmony, and peace in it. All I saw were students performing their best and fi ghters sharing mutual respect. Now, are you intrigued enough to join an Aikido class?

Mr. Witjaksono
THE HOME OF
BATIK ARTISTS
BEHIND THOSE OLD WALLS IS WHERE THE LEGENDARY HAND-PAINTED BATIK LASEM IS CREATED?
WCentral alking past old in
RED AS BLOOD
of Central Java, all by hand. The history of Batik Lasem began when Bhre Lasem ruled the town from 1350-1375 during the Majapahit Dynasty, when aristocrats wore batik as their luxury clothing. The Chinese and the Dutch cultures, as well as the Japanese, infl uenced the Batik Lasem patterns when Japan took over the country. And after centuries, this traditional art is still as captivating.
This street is home to two houses that play a major role in the history of Batik Lasem. The fi rst house belonged to the late Widji Soeharto, who perfected the red getih pithik (chicken blood) formula that was fi rst inherited by his father in law. Ever since he passed away, his son, 29-year-old Henry Ying, now runs the business.
Java, you would never guess that wonderful fabrics are being created inside. But hidden behind those aging walls, a number of well-trained batik artists are producing Batik Lasem, one of the masterpieces
66
BALI&BEYOND JULY 2015
Getih pithik is a particular red color that makes Batik Lasem special. Before it was made of chemicals like it is today, the dye was made of plants. However, science showed that it is actually the minerals found in the water in Lasem that creates this dark red hue. This dye is also the base of Batik Tiga Negeri that consists of blue, red and sogan (brown). Although concrete literary evidence is still inadequate, it is believed that Batik Tiga Negeri represents the three regions where its process takes place ? blue for Pekalongan, red for Lasem, and sogan for Solo where the fi nishing touches are done. Another reference says that Batik Tiga Negeri?s patterns are a representation of Dutch culture (blue), Chinese (red), and Javanese (sogan). The batik motifs are Latoh from sea plants, Kricak from the gravel of broken rocks (inspired by the slavery during the building of the Raya Pos Road that passed through Lasem during the Dutch colonial times), and
Sekar Jagad, a classic fl oral motif. It takes three to four months to create the Sekar Jagad motif, and a piece of Sekar Jagad batik sells for from two to 30 million rupiah.
LOW AND GLORY
The second house on the street that is also rich with history belongs to 86-year-old Sigit Witjaksono. Mr. Witjaksono is a businessman with detailed memories of the batik history in Lasem. Back in Batik Lasem?s glory days, his father exported the fabrics to Suriname, Malaysia and Singapore. When Japan occupied the country, Batik Lasem suffered its lowest time, and this continued until the ?70s. In the ?80s, many batik businesses went bankrupt, but Mr. Witjaksono was one of the very few businessmen who survived. To keep up with the new world, Mr. Witjaksono developed a new pattern by writing proverbs using Chinese characters. ?This is my effort to show the
acculturation in Lasem,? Mr. Witjaksono explained regarding his design. Eight years ago he started this design merely as an experiment, but today it is one of the favorites in the market. Before the proverbs, the Chinese infl uence in Batik Lasem was only in drawings such as dragons and the hong bird (phoenix). Behind the walls of this house the batik artists who work for Mr. Witjaksono are deep into their creations before they dry the fabric under the sun, while Mrs. Witjaksono with two helpers are making material for dye. The smell of malam (wax) fi lls the air from hot canting and wok in the backyard

batik workshops like Henry?s and Mr. Witjaksono?s back in the spotlight, and hopefully new talent will be discovered that will bring these fabrics to the worldwide fashion industry. As the wind blows salt air in from
the sea, slowly eroding these old abandoned buildings, I hope that Batik Lasem won?t crumble but stand up to the test of time. And that it will continue its journey for centuries  to come. By Taufan Wijaya
SENSE OF ART
All Batik Lasem is hand-drawn so the beauty depends on the artist?s sense of art, which means the sustainability of Batik Lasem depends on the artist?s regeneration. Mr. Witjaksono admits that it is diffi cult to fi nd new batik artists. However, ever since UNESCO recognized batik as an Indonesian heritage, Batik Lasem has progressed signifi cantly. This puts

Call an ambulance by dialing 118, but it is a lot more practical and quicker to hire a taxi. Most hotels have on-call doctors on standby. For ?Bali Belly?, Lomotil and Imodium eliminate symptoms, but not gastro-related infections. A fever along with symptoms requires doctor-prescribed antibiotics. Drink as much liquid as possible. Isotonic drinks under various brand names are widely available and are known to replenish body hydration and replace fl uids. For discomfort, diarrhea and cramping, drink strong, hot tea avoid fruits and spicy foods. Some day-biting mosquitoes carry dengue fever, but this is not a problem in tourist areas. Bali is non-malarial and prophylaxis is not required. Mosquito bites, cuts or abrasions easily become infected in the tropics. Treat them immediately. Drink only bottled or boiled water. Peel fruit before eating avoid raw vegetables except at reputable restaurants. Ice in restaurants is safe. Protect yourself from the intense equatorial sun. Use high SPF sunblock and a hat. AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are increasing in Indonesia. Local sex workers have multiple partners from around the world. They are not checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Act responsibly and use condoms, available over the counter at pharmacies.
