<h2 class="main-title">Introduction</h2>
<p id="N1020D">The innate immune response–the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and mobilisation of dedicated immune cells–confers a broad protection against pathogens to all multicellular organisms. <i>Drosophila</i> has become a model for studying the role of hematopoietic (blood) cells and the evolution of cellular immunity (reviews by <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Lemaitre1">[1]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Crozatier1">[2]</a>). Similar to vertebrates, <i>Drosophila</i> hematopoiesis occurs in two waves during development <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Evans1">[3]</a>. A first population of hemocytes is specified in the embryo and gives rise to plasmatocytes involved in phagocytosis and crystal cells required for melanisation <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Bataille1">[4]</a>. A second wave of plasmatocyte and crystal cell production occurs at the end of larval development. Larval hematopoiesis can also give rise to a third cell type, the lamellocytes, which are devoted to the encapsulation of foreign bodies too large to be phagocytosed. Lamellocytes only differentiate in response to specific immune challenges such as parasitisation by wasps, a common threat for higher order insects <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Lemaitre1">[1]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Crozatier1">[2]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Lanot1">[5]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Rizki1">[6]</a>. Larval hematopoiesis takes place in a specialised organ, the lymph gland (LG), which forms during embryogenesis and grows during larval development. In third instar larvae, the LG is composed of several lobes with the anterior-most lobes organised into a medullary zone (MZ) containing the hematopoietic progenitors, a cortical zone (CZ) containing differentiating hemocytes, and a so-called posterior signalling centre (PSC) (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figure 1F</a>) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Jung1">[7]</a>. These three zones can be identified by the expression of different markers. Differentiating crystal cells and plasmatocytes in the CZ express prophenoloxidase (proPO) and the P1 Nimrod receptor <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Kurucz1">[8]</a>, respectively. Hematopoietic progenitors can be distinguished by their expression of <i>domeless</i> (<i>dome</i>), which encodes the <i>Drosophila</i> receptor of the janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and <i>tep4</i>, which encodes a thioester protein <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Jung1">[7]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>. PSC cells express the transcription factors Antennapedia (Antp) and Collier/Knot (Col), the <i>Drosophila</i> Early B-cell Factor (EBF) ortholog <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Dubois1">[10]</a>, and the morphogen Hedgehog (Hh) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Jung1">[7]</a>,<a href="./pbio.1000441_files/pbio.1000441.html">[11]</a>–<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Lebestky1">[13]</a>. The PSC controls the balance between multipotent prohemocytes present in the MZ and differentiating hemocytes <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Mandal1">[12]</a>. It acts in a non–cell-autonomous manner, perhaps via Hh signalling, to maintain JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes, thus preserving the multipotent character necessary for these cells to adopt a lamellocyte fate upon parasitisation. This key role of the PSC revealed that, in <i>Drosophila</i>, larval hemocyte homeostasis is dependent upon interactions between hematopoietic progenitors and their micro-environment, a role reminiscent of the vertebrate hematopoietic niche <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Mandal1">[12]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Crozatier3">[14]</a>.</p>

<p id="N102AC">JAKs and STATs mediate intracellular signalling in response to secreted type I cytokines <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Darnell1">[15]</a>. In mammals, large families of cytokines and single-pass transmembrane receptors, named type I cytokine receptors, which signal as either homodimers or heteromers, have been identified (for review <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Kristensen1">[16]</a>–<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-OShea1">[19]</a>). JAK kinases are anchored to the intracellular part of signalling receptors. Binding of the cytokine induces conformational changes in the latter that bring two JAKs in close proximity. This allows JAK trans-phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the receptor, thereby creating a docking site for STAT transcription factors. STATs become in turn phosphorylated, leading to their dimerisation and translocation into the nucleus where they function as transcriptional regulators. Recent finding in <i>Drosophila</i> also point to a noncanonical mode of JAK/STAT signalling, which could directly control heterochromatin stability (for review <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Li1">[20]</a>). Altered JAK/STAT activity has been associated with several human diseases including leukaemia, myocardial hypertrophy, and asthma, while knock-out studies in mice point to a central role in hematopoiesis and regulation of immune functions <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-OShea2">[21]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Shuai1">[22]</a>. In contrast to mammals, only one receptor, Domeless (Dome), one JAK (Hopscotch, Hop), one STAT (Stat92E or Marelle) and three cytokines, Unpaired (Upd), Upd2, and Upd3 have been functionally characterised in <i>Drosophila</i> (for review <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Arbouzova1">[23]</a>). Sequencing of the <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome revealed, however, the existence of a <i>dome</i>-cognate gene (<i>CG14225</i>, renamed here <i>latran</i> [<i>lat</i>]) (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figure 1</a>) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Hombria1">[24]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Hou1">[25]</a>.</p>
<p id="N102F5">We report here that <i>lat</i> acts as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway during larval hematopoiesis. <i>lat</i> is required for turning off JAK/STAT signalling in hematopoietic progenitors following wasp parasitisation, thereby allowing the massive differentiation of lamellocytes. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate that Latran (Lat) forms heteromers with Dome and antagonises Dome function in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies thus revealed a novel mode of regulation of JAK/STAT signalling, based on differential and tissue-specific expression of signalling and antagonist cognate receptors. The tight tissue-specific regulation of JAK/STAT signalling by <i>latran</i> is crucial for <i>Drosophila</i> to be able to mount a dedicated cellular immune defense. A negative regulation of JAK/STAT signalling by a nonsignalling receptor chain has, so far, only been reported in primary and cultured mammalian cells, for short versions of class I cytokine receptors <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Diveu1">[26]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Rahaman1">[27]</a>. However, the in vivo function of these short membrane receptors and how their expression is regulated and linked to tissue homeostasis remain to be established. The specific role of <i>Drosophila lat</i> in controlling a dedicated cellular immune response raises the possibility that nonsignalling receptors could control specific aspects of vertebrate immunity, prefiguring a new field of investigations on this pathway.</p>

<i>CG14225/latran</i> Encodes a JAK/STAT Receptor-Like Protein</h3>
<p id="N1031A">Vertebrate class I (one) cytokines bind to receptors composed of various single-pass transmembrane protein chains that form homo- and heteromeric complexes. Dome is the only class I cytokine receptor that has, so far, been characterised in <i>Drosophila</i> <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Brown1">[28]</a>–<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Chen1">[31]</a>. Existence of a <i>D. melanogaster</i> gene, <i>CG14225/lat</i>, coding for a protein structurally related to Dome was noticed several years ago <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Hombria1">[24]</a>. <i>dome</i> and <i>lat</i> are adjacent to each other on the X chromosome and transcribed in the same orientation, suggesting that they originated from a gene duplication event (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figure 1A</a>). The key role of JAK/STAT signalling in regulating larval hemocyte homeostasis <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Gregory1">[32]</a> led us to ask whether <i>lat</i> was involved in this regulation. We first experimentally defined the 5′ end of <i>lat</i> transcripts by RACE-PCR, using total RNA from LGs. We positioned the <i>lat</i> methionine initiation codon and established that 153 bp separate the 3′ end of <i>dome</i> mRNAs from the <i>lat</i> transcription start site (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figures 1</a> and <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s001">S1A</a>). Dome and Lat show strong similarity in their extracellular domains, which include, from N- to C-terminal, a signal peptide, a cytokine binding motif (CBM) related to that of vertebrate receptors, and an approximately 200 amino acid region not found in vertebrate receptors (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figures 1B</a> and <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s002">S2</a>). We designate this region, whose function remains unknown, as LDHR for Lat-Dome Homology Region. Similar to the human class I cytokine receptor GP130, Dome contains three tandemly arranged fibronectin type III (Fn III) motifs. None Fn III motif are found in Lat. The intracellular region of Lat is shorter than that of Dome and shows no consensus STAT binding site (motif YXXQ, <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Hou1">[25]</a>) suggesting that <i>lat</i> encodes a nonsignalling form of cytokine receptor. A search for <i>dome/lat</i>-related genes in available genomes of other <i>Drosophila</i> species indicated that <i>lat</i> and <i>dome</i> are arranged in tandem, with an intergenic region varying from 150 bp (<i>D. melanogaster</i>) to 2.5 kb (<i>D. virilis</i>) (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s003">Figure S3</a>).

<i>lat</i> Is Specifically Expressed in Hematopoietic Progenitors in the <i>Drosophila</i> LG</h3>
<p id="N1039F">In situ hybridisations show that unlike <i>dome</i>, <i>lat</i> is not expressed in embryos, a result confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (unpublished data). Thus, despite genomic proximity, the control of <i>lat</i> transcription is different from that of <i>dome</i>. In larvae, <i>lat</i> transcription was detected only in pericardial and LG cells. In situ hybridisation onto LGs expressing a membrane targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) either in the MZ (dome-Gal4/UAS-mcd8 GFP (dome&gt;GFP)) or the PSC (pcol85/UAS-mcd8GFP (pcol&gt;GFP)) indicated that <i>lat</i> is only expressed in the MZ (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g001">Figure 1C–1F</a>).

<i>lat</i> Mutants Are Fully Viable but Unable to Mount a Cellular Immune Response against Wasp Parasitisation</h3>
<p id="N103CC">To determine if <i>lat</i> plays a role in larval hematopoiesis, we generated a <i>lat</i> null allele by homologous recombination <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Gong1">[33]</a>. Several independent recombination events were obtained and homozygous mutant lines were established (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s001">Figure S1</a>). Homozygous and trans-heterozygous combinations of these lines produced fertile adults with no obvious morphological defects, indicating that <i>lat</i> is not essential for either viability or germ-line development. In particular, no phenotypic defect was observed in the eye, where the JAK/SAT pathway plays an important role in growth and patterning <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Tsai1">[34]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Ekas1">[35]</a>. We then looked at the morphology of the LG in <i>lat</i> mutant larvae, using specific markers for the MZ (<i>tep4</i>), the PSC (<i>col</i>), or for differentiated hemocytes: crystal cells (<i>doxA3</i>) and plasmatocytes (P1). No obvious difference could be found between wild type (wt) and <i>lat</i> mutant larvae, suggesting that <i>lat</i> is neither required for the ontogeny of the LG, nor for the differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s004">Figure S4</a>). The third type of <i>Drosophila</i> hemocytes, the lamellocytes (identified by the integrin α chain [α-PS4 marker]), massively differentiate at the expense of the pool of hematopoietic progenitors upon wasp parasitisation; they start to differentiate in the LG before being released into the hemolymph. In wt larvae, the number of circulating lamellocytes reaches its maximum 48 h after wasp egg-laying <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Lanot1">[5]</a>. In sharp contrast to wt, virtually no circulating lamellocytes are found in the hemolymph of parasitised <i>lat</i> mutant larvae (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</a>), either 48 or 72 h after wasp egg-laying. Several days later, adult wasps hatch from parasitised <i>lat</i> mutant pupae. <i>srp</i>-Gal4 driven <i>lat</i> expression in the LG (<i>srp</i>&gt;<i>lat</i>) completely restored the ability of <i>lat</i> mutant larvae to produce lamellocytes following wasp parasitisation (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g002">Figure 2C</a>).

This lack-of-lamellocyte phenotype is rescued by expressing <i>lat</i> in the LG (C, arrows). (D–I) Prohemocytes, marked by dome-MESO expression (green) are not maintained in wt LGs following wasp parasitisation (D and E); this is paralleled by massive lamellocyte differentiation (integrin α chain [α-PS4], red) (E, insert). In <i>lat</i> mutant larvae, dome-MESO remains expressed after parasitisation (F, G); few lamellocytes differentiate (G, insert).

<p id="N104D6">The PSC (niche) is critically required to maintain a balance between JAK/STAT-positive progenitors and JAK/STAT-negative differentiating hemocytes in third instar LG <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>. The function of <i>lat</i> in the MZ raised the question of the relative contribution of positive and negative regulation by the PSC and <i>lat</i>, respectively, in the maintenance of this balance. Therefore, we examined the proportion of prohemocytes (expressing dome-MESO) and differentiating hemocytes in LGs double mutant for <i>lat</i> and <i>col</i> (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s005">Figure S5</a>). Whereas in <i>col</i> mutant LGs, which lack a PSC, the MZ disappears and all prohemocytes differentiate <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>, we observed a less severe phenotype in <i>lat;col</i> double mutants, namely the loss of an organised MZ with remaining prohemocytes intermingled with differentiated hemocytes (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s005">Figure S5A</a>).

<h3 class="section-title">Lat Is a Negative Regulator of JAK/STAT Signalling</h3>
<p id="N10513">The structural similarity between Lat and Dome together with <i>lat</i> function suggested that <i>lat</i> encodes a novel negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed <i>lat</i> in the MZ and followed JAK/STAT activity using dome-MESO expression. <i>lat</i> overexpression led to a complete inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in the MZ while both crystal cells and plasmatocytes were still able to differentiate (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g003">Figure 3A–3D</a>). To further investigate the possible mechanism behind this inhibition, we turned to reporter assay developed in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> Schneider (S2-NP) cells <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Baeg1">[29]</a>.

To assess for <i>lat</i> function, we transfected S2-NP cells with 10XStat92E-luciferase, Actin promoter-driven Renilla luciferase, Upd expression vectors (Act-renilla and Act-upd), together with Actin promoter-driven Dome (Act-dome) and/or Lat (Act-lat) expression vectors at various relative concentrations. Since high level of forced Dome expression could act as a dominant-negative <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Bach1">[39]</a>, we transfected low levels of Act-dome, which modestly increased JAK/STAT signalling (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g003">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, transfection of similar amounts of Act-lat severely decreased signalling (&gt;4-fold), confirming that <i>lat</i> acts as a negative regulator of the pathway (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g003">Figure 3E</a>) without affecting the level of Dome expression (unpublished data).

S2-NP cells were transfected with equivalent amounts of plasmids encoding tagged Dome(-V5) and Lat(-HA). Cell lysates were prepared 72 h post-transfection and subjected to IP with either anti-V5 or anti-HA antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis with one or the other antibody.

Briefly, this technique uses two β-Gal mutant forms (Δα and Δω) that are separately inactive but can complement each other if brought into proximity by fusing them to proteins that physically interact. Like for Dome <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Brown2">[42]</a>, Δα and Δω β-galactosidases were fused to the Lat C terminus.

Contrasting with this ubiquitous expression, X-gal staining was only detected in the salivary glands and hindgut when Dome Δα and Dome Δω were coexpressed as previously reported (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g004">Figure 4B</a>) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Brown2">[42]</a>. A similar staining pattern was observed upon coexpression of LatΔα/LatΔω LatΔα/DomeΔω or DomeΔα/LatΔω (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g004">Figure 4D, 4E</a>, and not shown), while no staining could be detected when only one fusion protein was expressed. These results indicate that Lat is able to form homodimers and heterodimers with Dome in vivo. We then tested β-gal complementation in the MZ using the <i>dom</i>e-Gal4 driver because <i>da</i>-Gal4 is not expressed in the LG (unpublished data).

These complementation assays show that Dome and Lat form heterodimers in the LG. Unfortunately we could not determine whether Dome or Lat can also form homodimers in the LG since <i>dome</i>-Gal4 driven expression of two copies of either Dome or Lat leads to early larval lethality. We observed, however, that <i>dome</i>-Gal4-driven expression of one copy of either Lat, LatΔα or LatΔω resulted in an “outstretched wing” phenotype in adult flies, a phenotype previously described for <i>upd</i> mutant flies, hence the name <i>outstretched (os/upd)</i> given to these mutants <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Wieschaus1">[46]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Harrison1">[47]</a>. This observation indicates that both the native and Lat fusion proteins are able to downregulate the JAK/STAT pathway. <i>eyeless</i>-Gal4 driven expression of <i>lat</i> in eye discs led to smaller eyes, another phenotype reminiscent of <i>upd</i> mutants (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s007">Figure S7</a>) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Bach1">[39]</a>, confirming that <i>lat</i> is able to downregulate JAK/STAT signalling in tissues other than the LG when ectopically expressed.

In this case, no decrease in the level of <i>dome</i> transcripts was observed upon wasp infestation, indicating that this decrease depends upon <i>lat</i> activity (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g005">Figure 5B</a>). In order to strengthen this conclusion, we tested whether decreasing JAK/STAT signalling in the LG by expressing dsRNA-<i>hop</i> (<i>srp</i>-Gal4 &gt; dsRNA-hop) could rescue the <i>lat</i> mutant phenotype. We indeed observed that lowering the level of Hop activity restored the ability of <i>lat</i> mutant LG to massively produce lamellocytes following wasp parasitism (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g005">Figure 5C</a>), confirming that <i>lat</i> acts upstream of <i>hop</i> in the signalling cascade. Together, these data lead us to propose that the shift in the relative levels of <i>dome</i> and <i>lat</i> expression observed following wasp egg-laying operates as a switch leading to a complete extinction of JAK/STAT signalling, thus allowing prohemocytes to differentiate.</p>

Since <i>upd2</i> mutants have no hematopoietic phenotype (unpublished data), <i>upd2</i> was not further considered in this study. We then focused on <i>upd3</i> expression and function. Since only genome annotation data were available, we determined the 5′ end of <i>upd3</i> transcript by RACE-PCR and repositioned the ATG initiation codon (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s008">Figure S8A</a>). In situ hybridisation of <i>upd3</i> transcripts in Dome &gt; GFP and pcol &gt; GFP LGs indicated that <i>upd3</i> is expressed in the MZ, the PSC, and in few scattered cells of the CZ (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</a>).

To directly test whether the decreased amount of <i>dome</i> transcripts in the LG that follows wasp parasitisation could result from the drop of <i>upd3</i> activity, we measured the relative amounts of <i>dome</i> and <i>lat</i> transcripts upon <i>upd3 dsRNA</i> expression in the MZ. Whereas the <i>lat</i> level was not affected, a 2-fold decrease was observed for <i>dome</i> transcripts (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g005">Figure 5D</a>). We conclude that the decrease in <i>dome</i> transcripts is a secondary response consecutive to decreased levels of <i>upd3</i> mRNA. Unlike <i>dome</i>, however, <i>upd3</i> downregulation is independent o<i>f lat</i> function (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g005">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, we propose the following model: wasp parasitism results in a drastic decrease in <i>upd3</i> levels, which in turn leads to a downregulation of JAK/STAT signalling and a decrease of <i>dome</i> transcription. This, in turn, results in an increased <i>lat/dome</i> ratio, which subsequently leads to the complete shut down of the JAK/STAT pathway. The complete and efficient inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling in the LG thus requires <i>lat</i> function (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g007">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<h2 class="main-title">Discussion</h2>
<p id="N1080D">The evolutionarily conserved JAK/STAT signalling pathway was discovered from studies on the role of interferon in the control of immune responses. Vertebrate genomes encode multiple forms of all major JAK/STAT pathway components, including multiple receptor subunits. As opposed to this, in <i>Drosophila</i>, only one functional receptor, Dome, had so far been characterised. However, sequence similarity between <i>dome</i> and the neighbouring gene <i>CG14225/lat</i> suggested a gene duplication event and raised the question of <i>lat</i> function.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Switching off JAK/STAT Signalling and Orienting Prohemocytes towards a Lamellocyte Fate: Two Facets of the <i>Drosophila</i> Immune Response to Wasp Parasitisation</h3>
<p id="N10822">In order to neutralise parasitoid wasp eggs, the <i>Drosophila</i> larval hematopoietic organ must rapidly release large amounts of lamellocytes in the hemolymph. In normal developmental conditions, the PSC maintains JAK/STAT signalling in the hematopoietic progenitor zone (MZ) thereby preserving their prohemocyte character. Upon wasp infestation, however, JAK/STAT signalling is switched off, leading to a concerted differentiation of prohemocytes into lamellocytes <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Krzemien1">[9]</a>. In <i>col</i> mutant LGs, which are devoid of PSC cells, no lamellocytes differentiate after wasp infestation as a consequence of the premature loss of multipotent prohemocytes; conversely, in <i>lat</i> mutant larvae, prohemocytes are maintained and very few lamellocytes differentiate. Prohemocytes persist in <i>lat;col</i> double mutant LGs, suggesting that a basal level of JAK/STAT signalling subsists in this mutant context, leading to a stochastic rather than global differentiation of prohemocytes. The comparison of <i>col</i>, <i>lat</i>, and <i>lat;col</i> mutant phenotypes, therefore, allows to conclude that <i>lat</i> functions as a switch. In normal developmental conditions, PSC activity overrides <i>lat</i> function in the MZ. Upon wasp infestation, PSC activity is short-circuited and <i>lat</i> plays a decisive role in completely silencing the JAK/STAT pathway in all prohemocytes. Hemocyte homeostasis in the LG thus relies on both extrinsic signals from the niche and intrinsic JAK/STAT activity in progenitor cells (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g007">Figure 7</a>). In <i>lat</i> mutants, some lamellocytes differentiate following wasp parasitisation indicating that <i>lat</i> is not strictly required for the lamellocyte differentiation programme per se. Thus, switching off JAK/STAT signalling and orienting prohemocytes towards a lamellocyte fate are two distinct responses to wasp parasitisation (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g007">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<h3 class="section-title">Differential Regulation of <i>lat</i> and <i>dome</i> Expression Warrants Inactivation of the JAK/STAT Pathway upon Wasp Infestation</h3>
<p id="N10861">In situ hybridisation and LG-targeted RNA interference experiments show that <i>upd3</i> is expressed and required in the MZ to maintain JAK/STAT activity in prohemocytes, therefore acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, as previously reported for Upd in embryos <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Harrison1">[47]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Gergen1">[51]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Sefton1">[52]</a>. The drastic decrease of <i>upd3</i> expression induced by wasp egg-laying is accompanied by a significant decrease in <i>dome</i> transcripts, showing that <i>dome</i> is both a component and a target of JAK/STAT signalling in the MZ (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g005">Figure 5</a>), as previously documented in the embryonic mesoderm <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Hombria2">[36]</a>. <i>lat</i> and <i>dome</i> mRNA levels are not, however, coregulated in response to parasitisation even though the two genes lie very close to each other on the chromosome, a tandem organisation conserved in other <i>Drosophila</i> species. The uncoupling between <i>dome</i> and <i>lat</i> expression results in an increased <i>lat/dome</i> ratio following wasp infestation, which is determinant for the ability of Lat to antagonise Dome activity. Comparative analyses of RNAs from wt and <i>lat</i> mutant LGs show that the primary component of the JAK/STAT pathway that is affected by wasp infestation is the level of <i>upd3</i> transcripts. Although we do not know yet how <i>upd3</i> is downregulated, it is tempting to speculate that it could be at a post-transcriptional level, similar to the importance of post-transcriptional regulation for cytokine levels in vertebrates (for review <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Anderson1">[53]</a>). In summary, our results show that a primary immune response to wasp egg-laying is a strong decrease in <i>upd3</i> mRNA levels in the LG, which induces a downregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway, followed by a decrease of <i>dome</i> and increase of <i>lat</i> levels. This results in an increased <i>lat/dome</i> ratio that further and completely turns off the JAK/STAT pathway. Since in the absence of <i>lat</i> the decrease in <i>upd3</i> level does not completely switch off the JAK/STAT pathway. We conclude that <i>Lat</i> acts as a switch that is required for the total arrest of JAK/STAT signalling in hematopoietic progenitors in response to wasp parasitisation, a prerequisite to massive differentiation of lamellocytes and efficient immune response (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio-1000441-g007">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<i>dome</i> and <i>lat</i>, a Pair of Duplicated Genes with Antagonistic Functions</h3>
<p id="N108CB">Dome is related to the human GP130 and cognate GP130-like (GPL) signalling receptors, which form heteromeric complexes with short, nonsignalling receptors such as IL-6R or Oncostatin M receptor (OSM-R) to mediate signalling (<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441.s009">Figure S9</a>) <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Diveu1">[26]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Diveu2">[54]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Ernst1">[55]</a>. <i>lat</i> encodes a short-type receptor that could either act as IL-6R and confer signalling specificity to Dome or as a dominant-negative receptor similar to what has been described ex vivo for short receptors such as GPL and IL13Rα2 <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Rahaman1">[27]</a>. Cell-culture and in vivo assays show that Lat antagonises Dome activity in a dose-dependent manner and forms heteromers with Dome thereby acting as a dominant-negative receptor. Altogether, these data suggest that, following parasitism, which leads to decreased cytokine levels, Lat blocks Dome activity in the LG through the formation of inactive heteromers.</p>
<p id="N108E9">While our analysis indicates that <i>lat</i> is specifically required in the larval hematopoietic organ for massive lamellocyte production in response to an immune challenge, phenotypes induced by ectopic <i>lat</i> expression show that it can antagonise JAK/STAT activity in other tissues. Together, the phenotypic and protein interaction data suggest that LG specific <i>lat</i> expression has been selected during evolution to fulfil specific immune functions.</p>
<p id="N108F4">Cytokine signalling pathways are subject to extensive positive and negative feedback regulations, which are crucial to generate appropriate physiological responses <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Shuai1">[22]</a>. Two genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens for JAK/STAT signalling components were conducted in <i>Drosophila</i> cultured cells. While they identified large sets of putative positive and negative regulators, they failed to detect <i>lat</i>, either because its expression level in cell culture is too low to be functional or because the <i>lat</i> dsRNA constructs used in these screens were not efficient enough <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Baeg1">[29]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Muller1">[30]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Muller2">[56]</a>. <i>col/kn w</i>as identified in one of these RNAi screens, however, as a positive regulator acting downstream of Hop <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Muller1">[30]</a>, suggesting another possible level of regulation of JAK/STAT signalling in the LG. Initial evidence for the involvement of JAK/STAT signalling in <i>Drosophila</i> cellular immunity came from the observation that a dominant gain-of-function mutation of the JAK kinase (<i>hop<sup>Tum</sup></i>) provokes the apparition of lamellocytes and melanotic masses in the absence of wasp infection. This finding led to the conclusion that upregulation of JAK/STAT signalling triggers lamellocyte differentiation, which is in apparent contradiction with our present data <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Gregory1">[32]</a>. Whether constitutive JAK/STAT signalling in differentiating hemocytes could instruct them to become lamellocytes remains an interesting possibility. Of note, a STAT target, <i>chimno</i>, was recently shown to be expressed at higher levels in differentiating CZ cells as compared to undifferentiated MZ cells <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Flaherty1">[57]</a>. Recent studies further suggest a dual role of Wg signalling in the maintenance of prohemocytes and PSC cells <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Sinenko1">[58]</a>. A tight control of ROS levels in the MZ is also required to maintain a pool of prohemocytes <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-OwusuAnsah1">[59]</a>. How these different signalling pathways are interconnected with JAK/STAT signalling in order to maintain hemocyte homeostasis in the LG are important questions to be addressed in the future.</p>

Soluble versions of short receptors isolated from diverse body fluids have also been identified, which behave as antagonists by competing with membrane-associated receptors for ligand binding <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Haque1">[62]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Mantovani1">[63]</a>. These soluble receptors are generated by either limited proteolysis or translation from differently spliced mRNAs. Finally, studies on IL13Rα2 <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Rahaman1">[27]</a> or GPL <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Diveu3">[64]</a> suggested that short receptors anchored to the membrane could also behave as dominant negative receptors. However, the exact function of these receptors and how their expression is regulated and linked in vivo to tissue homeostasis, remains unknown. Our studies in <i>Drosophila</i> indicate that Lat acts as a dominant-negative receptor rather than a coreceptor, extending in vivo the few observations made in mammalian cell cultures <a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-PerrotApplanat1">[65]</a>,<a href="file:///Users/burns/Coding/git/sciKnowMineProject/lapdftext/target/test-classes/sampleData/plos/8_8/pbio.1000441.html#pbio.1000441-Ross1">[66]</a>. Tissue-specific regulation of JAK/STAT signalling in response to environmental cues is crucial for the ability of <i>Drosophila</i> to mount a cellular immune defense. Our results bring to light a new mode of fine tuning of the JAK/STAT pathway, that is, differential expression of signalling and antagonist cognate receptors. Whether and when regulated expression of long and short receptor isoforms is employed in controlling specific aspects of immunity in vertebrates certainly deserves further investigation.</p>
